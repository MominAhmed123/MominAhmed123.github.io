Hello! My name is Momin and I am currently a Mathematics + Computer Science Double Major at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Within Computer Science, I am very much interested in algorithms and I am also currently quite involved in competitve coding. Within Mathematics, I like pure maths and I have also been involved with math olympiads.

Besides these two, teaching excites me alot. I have been involved with teaching Maths and CS for quite some time now. I really enjoy it and I think it's quite fulfilling. 

I am also 21 years old - which means I like video games. Oh, I also likes cats (very original, I know).

Check out my [Skills](#skills), [Expereiences](#exp), and [Awards](#awards) below!

</div>

  I love teaching - particularly things that I consider "cool". I find it to be quite unfortunate how elegant subjects such as Math and creative subjects such as CS are taught in schools in such an uninspiring and unmotivating manner - and I hope to play a part in changing that. 

  I have a lot of exprience teaching (refer to the "Experiences" section) and I have grown quite comfortable with the online mode of teaching.

  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Coding</h3>
</div>

  I have recently been addicted to competitve coding and I can see myself improving with every problem I solve. You can view my codeforces profile here.

  Besides competitve coding, I have been coding for more than 5 years now and I am quite comfortable with learning new things when need be. You can view my github for a few of the projects I worked on.

  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Familiarity with Languages</h3>
</div>

  I have worked with C/ C++/ Python/ Java and HTML / CSS (although they are not programming languages). Of those, currently C++ remains my go-to. I also use $ \LaTeX $ for writing my notes.  

  As for Human languages, I am fluent in English and Urdu (which means I can also understand and speak Hindi). I have passed the German A1 exam, although now Ich kann mich an nichts erinnern, was ich gelernt habe. Oh, I am also trying to learn Mandarin (我会说一点普通话).

<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px; border: 1px; color: #60c17d ; border-radius: 1px;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Familiarity with Libraries</h3>
</div>

  I have worked with pandas extensivly in python and I am quite comfortable with using it. Additionally, I am fimiliar with Keras/TensorFlow/Sickit Learn as I have worked on projects using them. I have also used GDK (a GUI library for C) although I would rather stay away from it (ㆆ _ ㆆ). Additionally, I also work with Manim - a math animations library for python. 

<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px; border: 1px; color: #60c17d ; border-radius: 1px;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Mathematics </h3>
</div>

  I have loved maths ever since I read "Art and Craft of Problem Solving" by Paul Zeitz in High School. Now in university, I am mostly studying Pure Maths (refer to last section for specific courses). In particular, Number Theory is my favourite area.

  I started my Math journey with Olympiad - you can refer to last section for a bunch of awards I got (no, I do not have any IMO medals :c ). I continue to be involved in Olympaid as I follow up with each year's IMO and seldom attempt a few questions. I am also active in Math Circles (in both Pakistan and Hong Kong) and I am also frequently available on AOPs as a grader.  

<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px; border: 1px; color: #60c17d ; border-radius: 1px;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Creative Media</h3>
</div>

  I am also decently good at Photo and Video Editing. In particular, I really like the entire creative process a lot although I must say video editing and animations are way too much effort than I would like to put in. Speaking of animations, I am also decent with math animations using Manim library. Lastly, I have built up a fair bit of experience designing posters and banners for socieities. Some of my projects are available on youtube.

  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Debating/ Public Speaking</h3>
</div>

  I have lots of experience from High school as I was part of MUN and Debate team. I continue to follow some WDC (World Debating Championship) matches, although now I do not find the time to engage in proper debating matches.

<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px; border: 1px; color: #60c17d ; border-radius: 1px;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Research</h3>
</div>

  My first (and currently only) experience was in Summer 2024 when I undertook a UROP under Prof. Fredrick Fong for "Geometric Flows". I gained a lot of valuable experience from this research - although I still need to learn much more to improve my research skills.

</div>

  I will only list a few important experiences (since the list is too long). 

  * I am currently working in AOPs as a grader. AOPs has online courses for olympiad preperation - I grade students' submissions for many areas of Mathematics and CS. 

  * I worked from 2021-2022 as a Mathematics Teaching Assistant (TA) at Nixor College. I held after class sesions from students having queries and held extra classes for exam preperation. 

  * I worked on "AltX" as a founding member and Senior Math instructor. AltX was a free online education platform for Alevel/Olevel courses. I was respondible for making courses (including lectures and quizzes) for Alevel Mathematics and Olevel Additional Mathematics. Additionally, I was also responsible for managing two other Math instructors by assinging weekly duties. However, the website is no longer online due to lack of instructors although the lectures are still available on youtube.

  * "Grasp" was an online olympiad platform that I started along with a friend. The purpose was similar to AOPs, to post solutions to olympiad problems. The difference was that we wanted there to be a hint system, so that you may still have another shot at the problem, and also a tag system, so you could focus on a specific area. We also wanted to cover some olympaids that are not mainstream (hence not available at aops). We worked on this project for about 4 months, however this project no longer exists as we did not see much success.

<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 3px; border: 1px; color: #60c17d ; border-radius: 1px;">
  <h3 style="margin: 0;">Youtube</h3>
</div>

  I make videos about some nice things I want to share - solutions from Math Olympiads mostly. I try to make these videos fun with a touch of GenZ humor (although I really do not do a good job, I think).

  I like making these videos and I must say I have learnt a lot. I have witnessed my skills improving a lot - I would initially record over and over again for even simple videos, now I usually get done in one take. The frequency of uploading has taken a hit since I do not usually find the time to make videos during packed semesters.

  I have a fair bit of informal experience as I've worked on a few projects. I usually just work on something when I have a reason to - instead of just doing it for the sake of building a portfolio. 

  Refer to "Projects" section to learn more about them. You can also check some of them out on github.
